  Handles 2 buttons being pressed at the same time.
  These are to be handled in your sketch with a callback
  "onButtonDualPress(uint8_t btn1, uint8_t btn2)"
  If the callback is not setup then BMC will not read simultaneous presses

  Here's how it works, when a button is pressed BMC will wait for another button
  to be pressed, when the second button is pressed BMC will trigger the callback
  with the index of each button pressed.
  For the callback to be triggered both buttons must be pressed within a time
  determined by BMC_BUTTON_DUAL_PRESS_TIMEOUT which is default at 75 milliseconds.
  Once the second button pressed is detected the callback is triggered and none
  of the events of either button will be triggered until they have been released.
  Only the first "Press" event of the first button will be triggered immediately.
  For this matter I recommend that all buttons that will be used as Dual Press
  should not have a "Press" event instead they should have "Release" events.
  Another Dual Press will not be detected until both buttons that triggered the
  dual buttons pressed are released.

  Here's a quick example to properly use this feature

  #include <BMC.h>
  BMC_DEFAULT();
  void setup(){
    bmc.begin();
    bmc.onButtonDualPress(callback);
  }
  void callback(uint8_t btn1, uint8_t btn2){
    // this callback is triggered any time 2 buttons are pressed simultaneously
    // for this example I'll check if the first and second button where pressed
    // at the same time, remember BMC is inclusive to Button #1 will be 0, #2 is 1, etc.
    // ALSO the lowest button number will always be btn1, so if button #2 is detected
    // first and button #1 is detected second then "btn1" will carry the index of
    // button #1 and "btn2" will carry the index of button #2
    if(btn1==0 && btn2==1){
      BMC_PRINTLN("Buttons #1 and #2 were pressed simultanously");
    }
  }
  void loop(){
    bmc.update();
  }



  These Dual Button Presses are usually used for Utility, maybe to change Pages,
  save edits, maybe even to change stores.
