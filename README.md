# **Badass MIDI Controller (BMC)**

[Official BMC Website @ BadassMIDI.com](http://www.badassmidi.com/)

## BMC 2.0 is Here! üöÄ
### For Teensy 3.x, 4.x & Teensy Micromod ([BMC now supports some ESP32 boards!](#esp32-support))

‚ö† **BMC 2.0 is NOT compatible with previous versions of BMC!, you will need to create a new config file and backups for older versions are not compatible.**

BMC 2.0 is a major re-write of the BMC core. If you're upgrading from an older version, you'll need to create a new config file. Learn more about the changes [here](#documentation).

üìå **Before proceeding, please review the [Installation](#installation) requirements!**

‚úÖ **Download the BMC library directly from the Arduino Library Manager.**

## What is BMC?
BMC (**Badass MIDI Controller**) is a powerful MIDI controller library designed for **Teensy** boards ([BMC now supports some ESP32 boards!](#esp32-support)). It comes with a **companion editor app** that lets users design their MIDI controller‚Äôs hardware and UI **without writing code**. 

### How It Works
1. **Design Your MIDI Controller** üõ†Ô∏è  
   - Specify buttons, LEDs, potentiometers, encoders, displays, MIDI ports, and more.
   - Configure the **UI layout** to match your physical hardware setup.
   - Customize the UI elements (e.g., different button styles and colors).
2. **Compile & Upload** üöÄ  
   - BMC generates a **config.h** file that defines your controller setup.
   - The library compiles with this config file to enable only the required features.
3. **Edit & Manage** üéõÔ∏è  
   - Use the editor app to modify settings and  data in EEPROM‚Äîno need to re-upload code!

‚úÖ **No coding required!** BMC handles everything behind the scenes.  
üí° Advanced users can extend functionality using the **BMC API**.

## Supported Boards
- Teensy **Micromod**
- Teensy **4.1**
- Teensy **4.0**
- Teensy **3.6** *(‚ö† Not recommended for new designs)*
- Teensy **3.5** *(‚ö† Not recommended for new designs)*
- Teensy **3.2** *(‚ö† Not recommended for new designs)*
- ‚ú® **NEW!** ESP32 DEVKIT V1 BETA (Mini Displays currently not supported)
- ‚ú® **NEW!** SparkFun ESP32 BETA MicroMod (Mini Displays currently not supported)

## ESP32 Support
**BMC** has BETA support for **ESP32** boards! Currently, only the **ESP32 DEVKIT V1** (one of the most common boards) and the **SparkFun ESP32 MicroMod** are supported, with more boards to come as testing continues.

A few things to keep in mind:

- ESP32 support is in BETA, please report any issues.
- Since the ESP32 doesn't have **Native USB MIDI**, it relies solely on **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** MIDI for connectivity.
- BLE MIDI is always available taking the place of the USB MIDI port.
- Only 2 Serial Ports are available on pins 4/5 and 17/16
- **Mini Displays** are not supported yet, as they rely on a Teensy-specific library.
- The **Serial Monitor** is unavailable on the web editor app.
- When using the internal **EEPROM**, the size will always be 4,096 bytes.
- To use with ESP32, the NimBLE-Arduino library version 1.4.3 is required.
- The **BMC for ESP32 boards package** is a modified version of the official ESP32 package. Both can coexist, but if you select a board from the BMC package, you **MUST** have a `config.h` file in the sketch folder.

   - USB & USB Host MIDI support for controlling DAWs and MIDI apps (Teensy Only).
   - Up to **4 Serial MIDI Ports** (1 on ESP32) for legacy devices.
   - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) MIDI with added MIDIBLE module (always available on ESP32)
‚úÖ **Automatic Hardware Management**  
   - Reads buttons, encoders, pots, LEDs, and displays **without extra coding**.
‚úÖ **EEPROM Handling**  
   - Supports **built-in EEPROM**, **external I2C EEPROM (24LC256)**, or **built-in SD Card Reader**.
‚úÖ **MIDI Sync**  
   - Syncs with **Fractal Axe FX II**, **AX8**, **Logic Pro**, and more!

## Library Structure & Coding Style
‚úÖ **Macros**: Prefixed with `BMC_`, uppercase with underscores.
```c++
#define BMC_MIDI_CONTROL_CHANGE 0xB0
```

‚úÖ **Class Naming**: Prefixed with `BMC`, using camelCase.
```c++
BMCMidi, BMCTimer, BMCFlags, BMCMidiMessage
```

‚úÖ **Struct Naming**: Prefixed with `bmcStore`.
```c++
bmcStore, bmcStoreGlobalCustomSysEx
```

‚úÖ **Default API Initialization**:
```c++
// Creates an instance of BMCApi named bmc
BMC_DEFAULT();
// Equivalent to:
BMCApi bmc = BMCApi();
```

‚úÖ **The only code your Sketch needs!**:
```cpp
#include <BMC.h>

BMC_DEFAULT();

void setup(){
  bmc.begin();
}

void loop(){
  bmc.update();
}
```

## About BMC
BMC started in **2017** as a custom MIDI controller project for a **Fractal AX8** guitar processor. After struggling with Arduino libraries, the need for an easy-to-use editor app became clear. 

üí° **Why Teensy?**  
Teensy boards were the perfect solution due to their **built-in USB MIDI support** and superior **performance** compared to standard Arduinos.

Since then, BMC has evolved into a powerful **no-code MIDI controller framework** that saves time and effort, letting users focus on music instead of programming!
